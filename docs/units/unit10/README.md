A euphemism is commonly defined as an auspicious or exalted term (like "sanitation engineer")that is used in place of a more down-to-earth term (like"garbage man"). People who are partial to euphemisms stand accused of being"phony"or trying to hide what it is they are really talking about. And there is no doubt that in some situations the accusation is entirely proper. For example, one of the more detestable euphemisms I have come across in recent years is the term"Operation Sunshine", which is the name the U.S. Government gave to some experiments it conducted with the hydrogen bomb in the South Pacific. It is obvious that the government, in choosing this name, was trying to expunge the hideous imagery that the bomb evokes虏and in so doing committed, as I see it, an immoral act. This sort of process鈥攇iving pretty names to essentially ugly realities鈥?is what has given euphemizing such a bad name. And people like George Orwell鲁have done valuable work for all of us in calling attention to how the process works. But there is another side to euphemizing that is worth mentioning, and a few words here in its defense will not be amiss鈦?

To begin with, we must keep in mind that things do not have "real"names, although many people believe that they do. A garbage man is not "really"a"garbage man," any more than he is really a "sanitation engineer." And a pig is not called a"pig"because it is so dirty, nor a shrimp a "shrimp"because it is so small. There are things, and then there are the names of things, and it is considered a fundamental error in all branches of semantics to assume that a name and a thing are one and the same. It is true, of course, that a name is usually so firmly associated with the thing it denotes that it is extremely difficult to separate one from the other. That is why, for example, advertising is so effective. Perfumes are not given names like "Bronx Odor," and an automobile will never be called 鈥淭he Lumbering Elephant." Shakespeare was only half right in saying that a rose by any other name would smell as sweet. What we call things affects how we will perceive them. It is not only harder to sell someone a "horse mackerel'"sandwich than a "tuna fish"sandwich, but even though they are the "same"thing, we are likely to enjoy the taste of tuna more than that of the horse mackerel. It would appear that human beings almost naturally come to identify names with things, which is one of our more fascinating illusions. But there is some substance to this illusion. For if you change the names of things, you change how people will regard them, and that is as good as changing the nature of the thing itself.

Now, all sorts of scoundrels know this perfectly well and can make us love almost anything by getting us to transfer the charm of a name to whatever worthless thing they are promoting. But at the same time and in the same vein鈦? euphemizing is a perfectly ntelligent method of generating new and useful ways of perceiving things. The man who wants us to call him a "sanitation engineer" instead of a鈥済arbage man鈥?is hoping we will treat him with more respect than we presently do. He wants us to see that he is of some importance to our society. His euphemism is laughable only if we think that he is not deserving of such notice or respect鹿鈦? The teacher who prefers us to use the term鈥渃ulturally different children" instead of"slum children" is euphemizing, all right", but is doing it to encourage us to see aspects of a situation that might otherwise not be attended to虏.

The point I am making is that there is nothing in the process of euphemizing itself that is contemptible. Euphemizing is contemptible when a name makes us see something that is not true or diverts our attention from something that is. The hydrogen bomb kills. There is nothing else that it does. And when you experiment with it, you are trying to find out how widely and well it kills. Therefore, to call such an experiment "Operation Sunshine" is to suggest a purpose for the bomb that simply does not exist. But to call"slum children""culturally different" is something else. It calls attention, for example, to legitimate reasons why such children might feel alienated from what goes on in school i grant that sometimes such euphemizing does not have the intended effect. It is possible for a teacher to use the term "culturally different" but still be controlled by the term"slum children"s(which the teacher may believe is their"real"name)."Old people" may be called鈥渟enior citizens'鈥? and nothing might change. And鈥渓unatic asylums'鈥漨ay still be filthy, primitive prisons though they are called "mental institutions". Nonetheless, euphemizing may be regarded as one of our more important intellectual resources for creating new perspectives on a subject.

The attempt to rename "old people""senior citizens" was obviously motivated by a desire to give them a political identity, which they not only warrant" but which may yet have important consequences. In fact, the fate of euphemisms is very hard to predict. A new and seemingly silly name may replace an old one (let us say, "chairperson" for"chairman") and for years no one will think or act any differently because of it. And then, gradually, as people begin to assume that"chairperson" is the鈥渞eal' and proper name(or鈥渟enior citizen鈥?or鈥?tuna fish'or鈥渟anitation engineer'"), their attitudes begin to shift, and they will approach things in a slightly different frame of mind. There is a danger, of course, in supposing that a new name can change attitudes quickly or always. There must be some authentic tendency or drift in the culture to lend support to the change, or the name will remain incongruous and may even appear ridiculous. To call a teacher a"facilitator" would be such an example. To eliminate the distinction between"boys"and"girls"by calling them"childpersons" would be another.

But to suppose that such changes never "amount to anything" is to underestimate the power of names. I have been astounded not only by how rapidly the name "blacks" has replaced "Negroes"(a kind of euphemizing in reverse") but also by how significantly perceptions and attitudes have shifted as an accompaniment to the change.

The key idea here is that euphemisms are a means through which a culture may alter its imagery and by so doing subtly change its style, its priorities, and its values虏. I reject categorically the idea that people who use"earthy"language虏 are speaking more directly or with more authenticity than people who employ euphemisms. Saying that someone is "dead"is not to speak more plainly or honestly than saying he has "passed away." It is, rather, to suggest a different conception of what the event means. To ask where the"shithouse"is, is no more to the point than to ask where the "restroom"is. But in the difference between the two words, there is expressed a vast difference in one's attitude toward privacy and propriety. What I am saying is that the process of euphemizing has no moral content. The moral dimensions虏鈦?are supplied by what the words in question express, what they want us to value and to see. A nation that calls experiments with bombs 鈥淥peration Sunshine" is very frightening. On the other hand, a people who call鈥済arbage men鈥?sanitation engineers" can't be all bad.

## Summary [鈥媇(#summary)

This article delves into the multifaceted nature of euphemisms, challenging the common perception of them as mere tools for deception or obfuscation. While acknowledging that euphemisms can be misused, as in the case of "Operation Sunshine" masking the destructive nature of hydrogen bomb experiments, the author argues for a more nuanced understanding. The central thesis is that euphemisms are not inherently good or bad; their moral value depends on the context and intent behind their use. The author contends that names and things are not intrinsically linked, and altering language can reshape perceptions and even the nature of the thing itself. This power can be harnessed for manipulation, but it can also serve as a catalyst for positive change by introducing new perspectives and values. The article concludes that the process of euphemizing is morally neutral, with its ethical implications derived from the underlying message and the values it promotes.
