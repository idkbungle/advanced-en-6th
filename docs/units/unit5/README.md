1 Despite all the current fuss and bother'about the extraordinary number of ordinary illiterates who overpopulate our schools, small attention has been given to another kind of illiterate, an illiterate whose plight is, in many ways, more important, because he is more influential. This illiterate may, as often as not, be a university president, but he is typically a Ph.D., a successful professor and textbook author. The person to whom I refer is the straight-A illiterate, and the following is written in an attempt to give him equal time with his widely publicized counterpart虏.

2 The scene is my office, and I am at work, doing what must be done if one is to assist in the cure of a disease that, over the years, I have come to call straight-A illiteracy. I am nterrogating, I am cross-examining, I am prying and probing for the meaning of a student's paper.鲁 The student is a college senior with a straight-A average, an extremely bright, highly articulate student who has just been awarded a coveted fellowship to one of the nation's outstanding graduate schools. He and I have been at this, have been going over his paper sentence by sentence, word by word, for an hour. "The choice of exogenous variables in relation to multi-colinearity," I hear myself reading from his paper, "is contingent upon the derivations of certain multiple correlation coefficients." I pause to catch my breath. "Now that statement," I address the student鈥攚hom I shall call, allegorically, Mr. Bright鈥?that statement, Mr. Bright, what on earth does it mean?鈥滿r. Bright, his brow furrowed鈦? tries mightily. Finally, with both of us combining our linguistic and imaginative resources, finally, after what seems another hour, we decode it. We decide exactly what it is that Mr. Bright is trying to say, what he really wants to say, which is:鈥淪upply determines demand.鈥?

3 Over the past decade or so, I have known many students like him, many college seniors suffering from Bright's disease鈦? It attacks the best minds, and graduallydestroys the critical faculties鈦? making it impossible for the sufferer to detect gibberish in his own writing or in that of others. During the years of higher education it grows worse, reaching its terminal stage, typically, when its victim receives his Ph.D. Obviously, the victim of Bright's disease is no ordinary illiterate. He would never turn in a paper with misspellings or errors in punctuation; he would never use a double negative or the word"irregardless'." Nevertheless, he is illiterate, in the worst way: he is incapable of saying, in writing, simply and clearly, what he means. The ordinary illiterate 鈥攑erhaps providentially protected from college and graduate school鈦糕€攎ightsay: "Them people down at the shop better stock up on what our customers need, or we ain't gonna be in business long." Not our man. Taking his cue irom years of higher education鹿掳, years of reading the textbooks and professional journals that are the major sources of his affliction, he writes: "The focus of concentration must rest upon objectives centered around the knowledge of customer areas so that a sophisticated awareness of those areas can serve as an entrepreneurial filter to screen what is relevant from what is irrelevant to future commitments." "For writing such gibberish he is awarded straight As on his papers (both samples quoted above were taken from papers that received As), and the opportunity to move, inexorably, toward his fellowship and eventual Ph.D.

4 As I have suggested, the major cause of such illiteracy is the stuft虏鈥攖he textbooks and professional journals鈥攖he straight-A illiterate is forced to read during his years of higher education. He learns to write gibberish by reading it, and by being taught to admire it as profundity. If he is majoring in sociology, he must grapple with鹿鲁 such journals as the American Sociological Review, journals bulging with barbarous jargon鹿鈦? such as "ego-integrative action orientation"鈦?and "orientation toward improvement of the gratificational- deprivation balance of the actor"鈦?(the latter of which monstrous phrases'鈦?represents, to quote Malcolm Cowley鹿鈦? the sociologist's way of saying "the pleasure principle"). In such journals, Mr. Cowley reminds us, two things are never described as being "alike." They are "homologous'鈦?or "isomorphic虏鈦?" Nor are things simply "different." They are "allotropic虏 ." In such journals writers never"divide anything." They"dichotomize虏虏" or "bifurcate虏鲁" things.

## Summary [鈥媇(#summary)

**English Summary**

The article addresses the issue of a specific type of illiteracy prevalent among high-achieving students, termed "straight-A illiteracy." Unlike conventional illiteracy, this form manifests as an inability to communicate clearly and simply, despite academic excellence. The author illustrates this through an anecdote involving a bright student whose complex academic jargon obscures simple meanings. The root cause is attributed to the convoluted language found in academic textbooks and journals, which students are compelled to study and emulate. This exposure leads them to produce similarly obscure writing, perpetuating a cycle of academic jargon that hinders effective communication. The article critiques the academic environment that fosters this form of illiteracy, emphasizing the importance of clarity and simplicity in expression.
