Quintus Fabius Maximus, one of the great Roman generals, was dubbed "Cunctator" (Delayer) for putting off battle until the last possible vinum break.鈦?Moses pleaded a speech defect to rationalize his reluctance to deliver Jehovah's edict to Pharaoh.鈦?Hamlet, of course, raised procrastination to an art form.

The world is probably about evenly divided between delayers and do-it-nowers. There are those who prepare their income taxes in February鈦? prepay mortgages and serve precisely planned dinners at an ungodly 6:30 p.m. The other half dine happily on leftovers at 9 or 10, misplace bills and file for an extension of the income tax deadline.

Yet for all the trouble procrastination may incur, delay can often inspire and revive a creative soul. Jean Kerr鹿鹿, author of many successful novels and plays, says that she reads every soup-can and jam-jar label in her kitchen before settling down to her typewriter. Many a writer focuses on almost anything but his task鈥攆or example, on the Coast and Geodetic Survey of Maine's Frenchman Bay and Bar Harbor, stimulating his imagination with names like Googins Ledge, Blunts Pond, Hio Hill and Burnt Porcupine, Long Porcupine, Sheep Porcupine and Bald Porcupine islands鹿虏.

From Cunctator's day until this century, the art of postponement had been virtually a monopoly of the military ("Hurry up and wait"), diplomacy and the law. In former times, a British proconsul faced with a native uprising could comfortably ruminate about the situation with Singapore Sling鹿鲁 in hand. Blessedly, he had no nattering Telex鹿鈦?to order in machine guns and fresh troops. A U.S. general as late as World War II could agree with his enemy counterpart鹿鈦?to take a sporting day off, loot the villagers' chickens and wine and go back to battle a day later. Lawyers are among the world's most addicted postponers. According to Frank Nathan, a nonpostponing Beverly Hills鹿鈦?insurance salesman, "The number of attorneys who die without a will is amazing."

Even where there is no will, there is a way.鹿鈦?There is a difference, of course, between chronic procrastination and purposeful postponement, particularly in the higher echelons of business.

The data explosion虏鈦?fortifies those seeking excuses for inaction鈥攁nother report to be read, another authority to be consulted. "There is always," says Manderbach, "a delicate edge虏鹿 between having enough information and too much."

His point is well taken.虏虏 Bureaucratization虏鲁, which flourished amid the growing burdens of government and the greater complexity of society, was designed to smother policymakers in blankets of legalism, compromise and reappraisal虏鈦粹€攁nd thereby prevent hasty decisions from being made. The centralization of government that led to Watergate虏鈦?has spread to economic institutions and beyond, making procrastination a worldwide way of life. Many languages are studded with phrases that refer to putting things off鈥攆rom the Spanish manana虏鈦?to the Arabic bukra fil mishmish (literally "tomorrow in apricots," more loosely "leave it for the soft spring weather when the apricots are blooming").

Academe also takes high honors虏鈦?in procrastination. Bernard Sklar, a University of Southern California sociologist who churns out three to five pages of writing a day, admits that "many of my friends go through agonies when they face a blank page.

Psychologists maintain that the most assiduous procrastinators虏鈦?are women, though many psychologists are (at $50-plus an hour) pretty good delayers themselves. Dr. Ralph Greenson, a U.C.L.A.?虏鈦?professor of clinical psychiatry (and Marilyn Monroe's鲁鈦?one-time shrink), takes a fairly gentle view of procrastination. "To many people," he says, "doing something, confronting, is the moment of truth鲁鹿. All frightened people will then avoid the moment of truth entirely, or evade or postpone it until the last possible moment." To Georgia State Psychologist Joen Fagan, however, procrastination may be a kind of subliminal way of sorting the important from the trivial. 鈥淲hen I drag my feet, there's usually some reason," says Fagan. 鈥淚 feel it, but I don't yet know the real reason."

In fact, there is a long and honorable history of procrastination to suggest that many ideas and decisions may well improve if postponed. It is something of a truism that to put off making a decision is itself a decision. The parliamentary process鲁虏 is essentially a system of delay and deliberation. So, for that matter, is the creation of a great painting, or an entree, or a book, or a building like Blenheim Palace鲁鲁, which took the Duke of Marlborough's鲁鈦?architects and laborers 15 years to construct. In the process, the design can mellow and marinate. Indeed, hurry can be the assassin of elegance. As T.H. White鲁鈦? author of Sword in the Stone, once wrote, time "is not meant to be devoured in an hour or a day, but to be consumed delicately and gradually and without haste."鲁鈦?In other words, pace鲁鈦?Lord Chesterfield, what you don't necessarily have to do today, by all means put off until tomorrow.

## Summary [鈥媇(#summary)

The article explores the concept of procrastination, examining its prevalence, causes, and consequences. It distinguishes between chronic procrastination and purposeful postponement, arguing that while the former can be detrimental, the latter can be beneficial, especially in creative and decision-making processes. The article provides historical and contemporary examples of procrastination, analyzes its psychological underpinnings, and suggests that delay can sometimes lead to better outcomes. It concludes that procrastination is a complex behavior with both negative and positive aspects, and that it should not always be viewed as a flaw.
