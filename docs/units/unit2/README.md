## Text and Translation

"Never put off till tomorrow," exhorted Lord Chesterfield in 1749, "what you can do today." That the elegant earl never got around to marrying his son's mother² and had a bad habit of keeping worthies like Dr. Johnson cooling their heels for hours in an anteroom attests to³ the fact that even the most well-intentioned men have been postponers ever⁴. Quintus Fabius Maximus, one of the great Roman generals, was dubbed "Cunctator" (Delayer) for putting off battle until the last possible vinum break.⁵ Moses pleaded a speech defect to rationalize his reluctance to deliver Jehovah's edict to Pharaoh.⁶ Hamlet, of course, raised procrastination to an art form.

1749 年，切斯特菲尔德勋爵告诫人们："今日事，今日毕。"然而，这位优雅的伯爵自己却从未与他儿子的母亲完婚，并且有个坏习惯，喜欢让约翰逊博士这样的名流在接待室里一等就是好几个小时。这都说明，即便是最善意的人，也难免有拖延的毛病。古罗马名将昆图斯·费边·马克西姆斯因总是将战事拖到最后一刻才开打，而被戏称为"拖延者"。摩西则以口吃为由，为自己不愿向法老传达耶和华的旨意找借口。当然，还有哈姆雷特，他简直把拖延症升华成了一门艺术。

## Analysis

1. **"Never put off till tomorrow," exhorted Lord Chesterfield in 1749, "what you can do today." That the elegant earl never got around to marrying his son's mother and had a bad habit of keeping worthies like Dr. Johnson cooling their heels for hours in an anteroom attests to the fact that even the most well-intentioned men have been postponers ever.**

   - **解析：** 这句话的难点在于其复杂的句式结构和嵌入的多个修饰成分。"Never put off till tomorrow what you can do today"是切斯特菲尔德勋爵的名言，意为"今日事今日毕"。"That"引导的从句是句子的主语部分，其中"the elegant earl"指代切斯特菲尔德勋爵，"never got around to marrying his son's mother"和"had a bad habit of keeping worthies like Dr. Johnson cooling their heels for hours in an anteroom"是并列的两个谓语部分，描述了他的拖延行为。"got around to"意为"抽出时间做某事"，"cooling their heels"是一个习语，意为"长时间无所事事地等待"，"anteroom"指"前厅"或"接待室"。"attests to the fact"意为"证明了……的事实"，其后是同位语从句，说明即使是最有良好意愿的人也一直是拖延者。"ever"在这里是副词，表示"一直"、"总是"。整个句子通过对比切斯特菲尔德勋爵的名言和他自己的拖延行为，说明了拖延症的普遍性。
