**1▶** Nothing in life is more exciting and rewarding than the sudden flash of insight that leaves you a changed person¹—not only changed, but changed for the better. Such moments are rare, certainly, but they come to all of us. Sometimes from a book, a sermon, a line of poetry. Sometimes from a friend. … .

**1▶** 人生中，没有什么比顿悟更激动人心、更有价值的了，它能让你脱胎换骨¹——不仅仅是改变，而且是变得更好。当然，这样的时刻并不多见，但我们每个人都会经历。有时它源于一本书、一次布道、一行诗句，有时则来自一位朋友……

**2▶** That wintry afternoon in Manhattan, waiting in the little French restaurant, I was feeling frustrated and depressed. Because of several miscalculations on my part, a project of considerable importance in my life had fallen through. Even the prospect of seeing a dear friend (the Old Man, as I privately and affectionately thought of him) failed to cheer me as it usually did. I sat there frowning at the checkered tablecloth, chewing the bitter cud of hindsight².

**2▶** 那是一个冬日的午后，在曼哈顿，我在一家小法餐馆里等人，感到沮丧而消沉。由于我的几次失算，生活中一个相当重要的项目失败了。即使是想到即将见到一位挚友（我私下亲切地称他为"老头儿"），也没能像往常那样让我振作起来。我坐在那里，盯着格子桌布皱着眉头，沉浸在事后诸葛亮的苦涩反刍中²。

3▶ He came across the street, finally, muffled in his ancient overcoat, shapeless felt hat pulled down over his bald head, looking more like an energetic gnome than an eminent psychiatrist. His offices were nearby; I knew he had just left his last patient of the day. He was close to 80, but he still carried a full case load³, still acted as director of a large foundation, still loved to escape to the golf course whenever he could.

4▶ By the time he came over and sat beside me, the waiter had brought his invariable bottle of ale. I had not seen him for several months, but he seemed as indestructible⁴ as ever. "Well, young man," he said without preliminary, "what's troubling you?"

5▶ I had long since ceased to be surprised at his perceptiveness.⁵ So I proceeded to tell him, at some length⁶, just what was bothering me. With a kind of melancholy pride', I tried to be very honest. I blamed no one else for my disappointment, only myself. I analyzed the whole thing, all the bad judgments, the false moves⁸. I went on for perhaps 15 minutes, while the Old Man sipped his ale in silence.

6▶ When I finished, he put down his glass. "Come on," he said. "Let's go back to my office."

7▶ "Your office? Did you forget something?"

8▶ "No," he said mildly. " I want your reaction to something. That's all."

9▶ A chill rain was beginning to fall outside, but his office was warm and comfortable and familiar: book-lined walls, long leather couch, signed photograph of Sigmund Freud⁹, tape recorder by the window. His secretary had gone home. We were alone.

10▶ The Old Man took a tape from a flat cardboard box and fitted it onto the machine. "On this tape," he said, "are three short recordings made by three persons who came to me for help. They are not identified, of course. I want you to listen to the recordings and see if you can pick out the two-word phrase that is the common denominator'in all three cases." He smiled. "Don't look so puzzled. I have my reasons."

11▶ What the owners of the voices on the tape had in common, it seemed to me, was unhappiness. The man who spoke first evidently had suffered some kind of business loss or failure; he berated himself for not having worked harder, for not having looked ahead. The woman who spoke next had never married because of a sense of obligation to her widowed mother; she recalled bitterly all the marital chances she had let go by". The third voice belonged to a mother whose teenage son was in trouble with the police; she blamed herself endlessly.

12▶ The Old Man switched off the machine and leaned back in his chair. "Six times in those recordings a phrase is used that's full of subtle poison¹². Did you spot it? No? Well, perhaps that's because you used it three times yourself down in the restaurant a little while ago." He picked up the box that had held the tape and tossed it over to me. "There they are, right on the label. The two saddest words in any language."

13▶ I looked down. Printed neatly in red ink were the words: If only.

14▶ "You'd be amazed," said the Old Man, "if you knew how many thousands of times I've sat in this chair and listened to woeful sentences beginning with those two words. 'If only,' they say to me, 'I had done it differently—or not done it at all. If only I hadn't lost my temper, said the cruel thing, made that dishonest move, told that foolish lie. If only I had been wiser, or more unselfish, or more self-controlled.' They go on and on until I stop them. Sometimes I make them listen to the recordings you just heard. 'If only,' I say to them, 'you'd stop saying if only, we might begin to get somewhere!'"

15▶ The Old Man stretched out his legs. "The trouble with 'if only," he said, "is that it doesn't change anything. It keeps the person facing the wrong way—backward instead of forward. It wastes time. In the end, if you let it become a habit, it can become a real roadblock, an excuse for not trying any more.

16▶ "Now take your own case: your plans didn't work out. Why? Because you made certain mistakes. Well, that's all right: everyone makes mistakes. Mistakes are what we learn from. But when you were telling me about them, lamenting this, regretting that, you weren't really learning from them."

17▶ "How do you know?" I said, a bit defensively.

18▶ "Because," said the Old Man, "you never got out of the past tense. Not once did you mention the future. And in a way—be honest, now!—you were enjoying it. There's a perverse streak in all of us that makes us like to hash over old mistakes.³ After all, when you relate the story of some disaster or disappointment that has happened to you, you're still the chief character, still in the center of the stage."

19▶ I shook my head ruefully. "Well, what's the remedy?"

20▶ "Shift the focus," said the Old Man promptly. "Change the key words and substitute a phrase that supplies lift instead of creating drag¹⁴."

21▶ "Do you have such a phrase to recommend?"

22▶ "Certainly. Strike out the words 'if only'; substitute the phrase 'next time.'"

23▶ "Next time?"

24▶ "That's right. I've seen it work minor miracles right here in this room. As long as a patient keeps saying 'if only' to me, he's in trouble. But when he looks me in the eye¹⁵ and says 'next time,' I know he's on his way to overcoming his problem. It means he has decided to apply the lessons he has learned from his experience, however grim or painful it may have been. It means he's going to push aside the roadblock of regret, move forward, take action, resume living. Try it yourself. You'll see."

25▶ My old friend stopped speaking. Outside, I could hear the rain whispering against the windowpane. I tried sliding one phrase out of my mind and replacing it with the other. It was fanciful, of course, but I could hear the new words lock into place with an audible click¹⁶ ...

26▶ The Old Man stood up a bit stiffly. "Well, class dismissed. It has been good to see you, young man. Always is. Now, if you will help me find a taxi, I probably should be getting on home."

27▶ We came out of the building into the rainy night. I spotted a cruising cab and ran toward it, but another pedestrian was quicker.

28▶ "My, my," said the Old Man slyly. "If only we had come down ten seconds sooner, we'd have caught that cab, wouldn't we?"

29▶ I laughed and picked up the cue. "Next time I'll run faster."

30▶ "That's it," cried the Old Man, pulling his absurd hat down around his ears. "That's it exactly!"

31▶ Another taxi slowed. I opened the door for him. He smiled and waved as it moved away. I never saw him again. A month later, he died of a sudden heart attack, in full stride, so to speak.

32▶ More than a year has passed since that rainy afternoon in Manhattan. But to this day, whenever I find myself thinking "if only", I change it to "next time". Then I wait for that almost-perceptible mental click¹⁷. And when I hear it, I think of the Old Man.

33▶ A small fragment of immortality¹⁸, to be sure. But it's the kind he would have wanted.

## Summary

- **English Summary**

The article recounts a transformative encounter between the narrator and an elderly psychiatrist, referred to as the "Old Man." Feeling frustrated and dejected due to a significant setback, the narrator shares his troubles with the Old Man, who, instead of offering direct advice, guides him through a unique exercise. By listening to recordings of others expressing regrets with the phrase "if only," the narrator realizes the destructive nature of dwelling on past mistakes. The Old Man introduces the concept of replacing "if only" with "next time," a forward-looking approach that encourages learning from the past and taking action. This simple yet profound shift in perspective leaves a lasting impact on the narrator, helping him navigate future challenges with a renewed sense of hope and determination. The Old Man's sudden death shortly after their meeting further solidifies the lesson, turning it into a lasting tribute to his wisdom.

## Analysis

1.  **Nothing in life is more exciting and rewarding than the sudden flash of insight that leaves you a changed person—not only changed, but changed for the better.**

    - **解析：** 这句话是一个复合句，其中包含了一个定语从句"that leaves you a changed person"来修饰"the sudden flash of insight"。"flash of insight"指的是"顿悟、灵光一现"，是较为抽象的表达。"not only changed, but changed for the better"使用了"not only...but also..."的结构，强调这种改变是积极的、向好的。

      这句话的核心意思是：生活中最令人兴奋和有益的事情莫过于那些让你焕然一新的顿悟时刻，这种改变不仅是改变，而且是变得更好。它开宗明义地点明了文章的主题，即顿悟给人带来的积极影响。

2.  **I sat there frowning at the checkered tablecloth, chewing the bitter cud of hindsight.**

    - **解析：** 这句话中，"chewing the bitter cud of hindsight"是一个较为复杂的隐喻表达。"cud"本意是指反刍动物（如牛）已经咽下又反刍到口中重嚼的食物。"hindsight"意为"事后诸葛亮、后见之明"。"bitter cud of hindsight"字面意思是"反刍苦涩的事后诸葛亮"，实际上是把"事后反思、懊悔"比喻成"反复咀嚼苦涩的食物"，生动形象地描绘了叙述者当时懊恼、悔恨的心理状态。

      这句话通过隐喻的手法，将抽象的心理活动具象化，增强了表达的感染力。

3.  **He was close to 80, but he still carried a full case load, still acted as director of a large foundation, still loved to escape to the golf course whenever he could.**

    - **解析：** 这句话使用了排比的修辞手法，三个"still"并列，强调了老人虽然年事已高，但仍然精力充沛，积极工作和生活。"carried a full case load"是一个习惯用语，指的是"承担了大量的工作、负责很多病例"。"escape to the golf course"则体现了老人热爱高尔夫球运动，喜欢在闲暇时放松身心。

      这句话通过排比和习惯用语，简洁有力地展现了老人充满活力、热爱生活的形象。

4.  **With a kind of melancholy pride, I tried to be very honest.**

    - **解析：** 这句话中，"melancholy pride"是一个比较矛盾的表达。"melancholy"意为"忧郁的、伤感的"，"pride"意为"自豪、骄傲"。将这两个看似矛盾的词语放在一起，构成了一种复杂的情感。"melancholy pride"指的是一种"带着忧郁的自豪感"，具体到这句话中，指的是叙述者在坦诚地剖析自己的错误时，既感到忧郁、懊悔，又因为自己的坦诚而感到一丝自豪。

      这种矛盾情感的表达，体现了叙述者当时复杂的心境，也为后文老人对他的开导做了铺垫。

5.  **There's a perverse streak in all of us that makes us like to hash over old mistakes.**

    - **解析：** 这句话中，"perverse streak"指的是"人性中固执的、反常的一面"。"hash over"是一个习惯用语，意为"反复谈论、纠缠于（不愉快的事情）"。这句话的意思是：我们每个人都有固执的一面，使得我们喜欢反复纠结于过去的错误。

      这句话揭示了人们普遍存在的一种心理倾向，即喜欢沉溺于过去的错误和失败中，难以释怀。这种心理倾向是人之常情，但也需要我们去克服。

6.  **It means he has decided to apply the lessons he has learned from his experience, however grim or painful it may have been.**

    - **解析：** 这句话是一个复合句，其中包含了一个"however"引导的让步状语从句。"however grim or painful it may have been"意为"无论这段经历多么残酷或痛苦"。"apply the lessons he has learned from his experience"指的是"将从经验中吸取的教训付诸实践"。

      这句话强调了从过去的经历中吸取教训的重要性，即使这些经历是痛苦的、不堪回首的。只有将教训付诸实践，才能真正地从错误中成长。

      这句话与前文的"if only"形成对比，强调了"next time"的积极意义，即从过去的错误中学习，并在未来做得更好。
