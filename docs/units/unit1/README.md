## Text and Translation

1▶ Nothing in life is more exciting and rewarding than the sudden flash of insight that leaves you a changed person¹—not only changed, but changed for the better. Such moments are rare, certainly, but they come to all of us. Sometimes from a book, a sermon, a line of poetry. Sometimes from a friend. … .

1▶ 人生中，没有什么比顿悟更激动人心、更有价值的了，它能让你脱胎换骨¹——不仅仅是改变，而且是变得更好。当然，这样的时刻并不多见，但我们每个人都会经历。有时它源于一本书、一次布道、一行诗句，有时则来自一位朋友……

2▶ That wintry afternoon in Manhattan, waiting in the little French restaurant, I was feeling frustrated and depressed. Because of several miscalculations on my part, a project of considerable importance in my life had fallen through.

## Summary

### English Summary

The article recounts a transformative encounter between the narrator and an elderly psychiatrist, referred to as the "Old Man." Feeling frustrated and dejected due to a significant setback, the narrator shares his troubles with the Old Man, who, instead of offering direct advice, guides him through a unique exercise. By listening to recordings of others expressing regrets with the phrase "if only," the narrator realizes the destructive nature of dwelling on past mistakes. The Old Man introduces the concept of replacing "if only" with "next time," a forward-looking approach that encourages learning from the past and taking action. This simple yet profound shift in perspective leaves a lasting impact on the narrator, helping him navigate future challenges with a renewed sense of hope and determination. The Old Man's sudden death shortly after their meeting further solidifies the lesson, turning it into a lasting tribute to his wisdom.
